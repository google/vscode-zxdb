## Prerequisites

1. If you don’t have the fuchsia source tree, see the
   [Fuchsia setup guide](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/get-started/get_fuchsia_source?hl=en).
1. If this is the first time using zxdb, see the
   [zxdb setup guide](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/debugger/running?hl=en).
1. If this is the first time using VS Code, see
   [VS Code setup for Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/editors/vscode?hl=en).

## Quick start

- **Step 0:** Open VS Code application and install **zxdb** extension from marketplace
  (Click **View** then **Extensions** and search for **zxdb**, select **zxdb** and click on
  **install**).

- **Step 1:** Make sure that the target device is running fuchsia and the package server
  (like `fx serve`) has started on the development host. Make sure to have installed the
  [zxdb](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fuchsia-authors.zxdb)
  extension from VS Code marketplace.

- **Step 2:** Open VS Code application. Open the Fuchsia source directory (Click **File** then
  **Open..** or **Open Folder..** then select the Fuchsia directory).

- **Step 3:** Open the source code of the program you want to debug and add breakpoints by clicking
  on the editor margin or using **F9** on the current line.

- **Step 4:** Add a launch configuration (Click **Run** then **Add Configuration**, if there is a
  drop down select zxdb). Update fields marked as _TODO_ in the launch.json. You only need to
  do this step whenever you want to update the configuration. See [this](#launch-configuration)
  section for more launch options.

  ![This figure shows a sample launch configuration.](images/test-launch-configuration.png)

- **Step 5:** Start debugging (press **F5** or **Play** button). See this
  [guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) to learn about VS Code debugger.

See [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/google/vscode-zxdb/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
if you face any issues.

## Launch Configuration

VS Code keeps debugging configuration information in a `launch.json` file located in a .vscode
folder in your workspace (project root folder) or in your
[user settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_global-launch-configuration) or
[workspace settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces#_workspace-launch-configurations).
In Step 4 of [Quick Start](#quick-start), this file is created automatically if it doesn’t
already exist.

You can add as many launch configurations as you need and pick one before starting to debug.

Follow these steps to update your launch configuration:

1. Click **Run** then **Open Configuration** to open launch configuration.
1. To add new configurations, Click **Run** then **Add Configuration** and scroll down to zxdb
   configuration snippets (_Hint: type zxdb to get there faster_).

   ![This image shows different launch configuration options.](images/launch-configurations.png)

1. Pick a configuration that matches your workflow.

   1. **Launch** configurations: Use this if you want to use VS Code to both launch and
      debug the program.

      Required fields:

      - Launch command: Shell command to launch the program.

        Example launch commands: fx test -o hello-world-test, fx shell i2cutil, fx run hello-world

      - Process name: Name of the process that will be started by the launch command.

        Example process name: hello-world-test, hello-world (partial names are also valid)

   1. **Attach** configurations: Use this if you want to use VS Code only for debugging.
      You need to launch the program manually.

      Required fields:

      - Process name: Name of the process to debug.

   An example launch configuration file can be found [here](https://github.com/google/vscode-zxdb/blob/main/example-launch.json)

1. Save the `launch.json`. The configuration names would appear in the launch configuration dropdown.

   ![This image shows the launch configuration dropdown.](images/launch-dropdown.png)

1. Select the required configuration from the dropdown and start debugging.

> **Tip**: Launch configuration can be quickly accessed by clicking on the gear button as shown below -
>
> ![This image shows the gear button that can be used to open launch configuration.](images/open-launch-configuration.png)

> **Note**: _Launch(zxdb) Input box_ / _Attach(zxdb) Input box_ configurations allow you to enter the
> customizable fields into a pop-up input box during every run just before the debugger starts.
> Use this as a generic configuration. However, inputs will not be saved and need to be entered in
> every run, which could be a compelling reason to update `launch.json` manually as described above.

## Extension configuration

To configure the extension, open settings (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` and type
**Preferences: Open Settings(UI)**). Type zxdb in the search bar to view and update the zxdb
extension configurations. After changing any of these configurations reload the VS Code window
(`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` and type **Reload Window**) for it to take effect.
